               <p>Long ago, glaciers carved out a lake bed that today is known by most as Lake Andes, and <hi rend="italic">Bde Ihanke</hi>
                   by Yanktons. Once the center of a post-reservation Indigenous community, the United States Fish and
                   Wildlife Service now manages the lake as a National Wildlife Refuge. This website explores the long,
                   strange journey of the lake &#8212; as it moved from a Yankton possession, to a state-supported bass bonanza, to
                   a federal wildlife refuge &#8212; with particular attention to land tenure, economic pursuits, and fishery ecology,
                   all unfolding under a backdrop of evolving legal doctrine and international treaties.</p>
